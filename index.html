    <h2>Caveats</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>THIS IS NOT A DICTIONARY!</b>
            There is
            <a href="https://github.com/QikLiang/hangul-sound-shift/blob/master/src/hangul_sound_shift/core.cljc">
                less than 200 lines of code
            </a>
            trying to apply the common patterns of the Korean language with (currently) no consideration for individual word exceptions.
            Use this to remind yourself that a sound shift is likely to occur, but check a dictionary if you need a definitive answer.
        </li>
        <li>
            As explained by Wikibooks, a "plain" consonant (ㄱ as example in the following) can have three pronunciations:
            unvoiced (가다), voiced (시간), or unreleased stop (학생).
            <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/voiced-and-voiceless-consonants-1212092">
                An explanation on voiced vs unvoiced consonants.
            </a>
            To a beginner of the language, a unvoiced consonant has more in common with their aspirated counterpart (ㅋ)
            than the voiced counterpart of the same sound.
            Although I've not seen it done anywhere else,
            I've taken the liberty to represent the unvoiced consonants with their aspirated equivalent.
            According to the KOREAN FULL COURSE video,
            the unreleased stop is also supposed to be more alike to the unvoiced than the voiced,
            but it's hard to hear the difference and I've decided to leave them as is to avoid further confusion.
        </li>
        <li>
            Many patchim take on a "t" sound (e.g. 옷 is supposed to be pronounced 옫).
            Conventionally, this "t" sound is represented by a ㄷ,
            but I've decided to use a ㅌ instead because the aspirated feels more like a "t" as I explained above.
        </li>
        <li>
            According to the KOREAN FULL COURSE video,
            a ㄹ more like a "r" at the beginning of a syllable and more like a "l" in the end of a syllable.
            Similarly, a ㅅ is more like a "sh" when paired with a ㅣ sound (시, 쉬, 샤, etc.) and more like a "s" otherwise.
            These changes are not represented here due to the limitations of Hangul.
        </li>
        <li>
            According to the KOREAN FULL COURSE video,
            a ㅎ that follows a nasal consonant (ㅁ, ㄴ, ㅇ, ㄹ) is supposed to be soft but still pronounced.
            I treat such ㅎ as completely silent to emphasize the consonant assimulation/resyllabification.
            When the ㅎ is surrounded by vowels on both sides, the same softening also happens,
            but I decided to leave them unchanged to show it's not completely silent.
        </li>
        <li>
            With the limitations mentioned above, why use Hangul instead of some romanization?
            Anyone learning Korean would know Hangul, and I felt it's not worth the time to learn any other romanization.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Alternative</h2>
    Only after I've finished making this did I discover
    <a href="http://pronunciation.cs.pusan.ac.kr/pronunc.htm">
        it has already been done
    </a>
    by the Pusan National University, which is likely more accurate.
    However, their tool can only convert one word or sentence at the time, while this page takes anything you want to throw at it.
    I thought this might still be useful if you want to, say, generate 5,000 flashcards at once.
